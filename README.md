Hi! I'm Alejandra González (*she / her*) a Rust programmer and tech enthusiast, you probably found me from [my contributions](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+author%3Ablyxyas&type=pullrequests) to the Rust Project, I also have a [cool blog](https://blog.goose.love/).

- Have been nominated for the [Google Open Source Peer Bonus award](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/growing/peer-bonus).
